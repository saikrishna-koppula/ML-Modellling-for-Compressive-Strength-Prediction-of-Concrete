# ML-Modellling-for-Compressive-Strength-Prediction-of-Concrete
## Overview
This project focuses on building a model to analyze and predict the properties of concrete based on its composition. Concrete is a widely used construction material, and understanding how its components affect its properties is essential for improving strength, durability, and cost efficiency.

## Objectives
Explore the relationships between various ingredients of concrete (e.g., cement, water, aggregates) and its resulting properties.
Develop a predictive model to estimate specific characteristics such as compressive strength.

## Implementation
### Data Collection and Cleaning:
Gathered a dataset containing records of concrete mixtures and their measured properties. Removed invalid or missing values to ensure accurate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Investigated the dataset to understand trends and relationships. Visualized correlations between different ingredients and concrete properties.

### Model Development:
Built and tested multiple models using techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. Evaluated each model's accuracy and reliability.

### Result Analysis:
Interpreted the results of the best-performing model. Identified which factors most influence concrete properties and summarized key findings.

### Documentation:
Compiled results and observations into a concise report to make the insights easy to understand.

## Future Work
### This project can be extended by:
- Adding more data for better generalization.
- Using advanced modeling techniques like neural networks for improved predictions.
- Incorporating real-world constraints like cost or environmental impact.
